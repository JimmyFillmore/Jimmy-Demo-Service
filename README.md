# Jimmy-Demo-Service
Setting up the appropriate web services to interact with the Eleos Platform app.

Routes:

url= https://jimmy-demo-service.herokuapp.com

               Messages =  url/api/messages/{handle}
           
    User Authentication =  url/api/authenticate/{token}

                  Loads =  url/api/loads
              
               Add user =  url/api/user
               
I learned quite a lot through this project, particularly in javascript, which is the language I used to build my web services. I used node.js and express to set up the api and prohairesis for my database. I have default html page that shows if you go to https://jimmy-demo-service.herokuapp.com, which I used to add my users at first.
